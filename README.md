Related to triggering and pausing an element’s transition. The solution is actually quite simple using JavaScript. To trigger an element’s transition, toggle a class name on that element that triggers it. The following is an example of that approach.

```JavaScript
var animationEnd = 'webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend';
this.addClass('animated ' + animationName).one(animationEnd, function() {
    $(this).removeClass('animated ' + animationName);
});
```
